The Project's Origin
====================
After Dr. Ribler departed LC on sabbatical, Dr. Meehean picked up where I left off with my MyLC app, but decided to shelve that project entirely in favor of something more interesting to him. Out of a crop of ideas, we settled on the following as a starting point:

My app could retrieve and display the most-commonly accessed links from the lynchburg.edu website. 
	1) A listener program that collects usage data from the site.
		a) Click analytics.
		b) Customer Lifecycle analytics.
		c) Packet analyzer (Fiddler, Wireshark)
	2) Analysis of that data in real time to identify trends
		a) What users clicked on, and in what order
		b) How they got there
		c) How many times they got "lost"
	3) Application of identified trends and patterns to improve the app's convenience.
		a) Heavily used links would be prioritized and pushed forward in the app's home page		

The project evolved over the course of the semester, and by the end of it, I was investigating the dark corners of Android process management and touch input handling in an effort to ask Dr. Meehean's questions every week. The entire process was documented in a paper journal, which I will upload eventually.
